# Tempercent

### About

A script that uses APIs ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com), [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/)) to calculate today's temperature as a percentage of the average over the past five years for this date. Served as a web app with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/).

### To Do:

- [x] type hints
- [x] requirements.txt
- ~~error handling for external calls~~
- ~~postcode validation via uk-postcode-utils~~
- ~~user input (CLI/API)~~ (half done, still need to do API)
- ~~swap f-strings for assembling URLs with requests library~~
- return page for bad postcode entr
- move API routes to external config file
- make get_past_five_years() take start_date arg to get past 5 years from any date
- ""``""pythonise2""`Â¬`" list comprehension (booo)
