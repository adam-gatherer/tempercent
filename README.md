# Tempercent

### About

A script that uses APIs ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com), [Postcodes.io](https://postcodes.io/)) to calculate today's temperature as a percentage of the average over the past five years for this date.

### To Do:

- ~~type hints~~
- requirements.txt
- ~~error handling for external calls~~
- postcode validation via uk-postcode-utils
- user input (CLI/API)
- swap f-strings for assembling URLs with requests library
- move API routes to external config file
- make get_past_five_years() take start_date arg to get past 5 years from any date
- ""``""pythonise2""`Â¬`" list comprehension (booo)
